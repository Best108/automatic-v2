For the period of 27/12/17-01/01/18, I (manic) am on holiday so will be unable to edit this repository.
Any support needed is directed at Zwack010#5682 on discord.

Please note that for 'accept_any_sell_order' as False to work you will need to read the README again. You can find that
here - https://github.com/mninc/automatic-v2/blob/master/README.md .
